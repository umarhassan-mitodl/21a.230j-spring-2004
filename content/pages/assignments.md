Reader Responses
----------------

You will notice on your syllabus that six "Reader Responses" are required during the course. Write several sentences about your reactions to one or two of the readings for that day. Write about your response; do not provide a summary or analysis, but your opinion, your reaction. In other words, provide a thoughtful engagement with the reading you’ve selected. How you do it is up to you.

These can be handwritten and should take no more than 10 minutes.

While reader responses are required and will be included in our evaluation of your performance in the course, they are not graded. Their purpose is to help you think about what you are reading and to give us a better idea of how students are reacting to the reading assignments.
