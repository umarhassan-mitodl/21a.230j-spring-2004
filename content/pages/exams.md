Information for Final Exam
--------------------------

Open book. You may bring notes as well.

None of the actual study questions handed out will be on the exam. They are intended to help you prepare for the exam by giving you examples of what the questions will be like.

It's an inefficient use of your time to write out answers to all the questions. Rather, use the questions to prepare by noting topics and the readings you are asked to discuss. Concentrate on those.

If you can, get together with one or two members of the class and review together. A very efficient use of your time.

You will notice that some of the readings on the syllabus do not appear in the questions. You will not be asked about any reading that isn't mentioned in the study questions.

We know that there are a lot of authors. You can bring the syllabus with you. The way the study (and exam) questions are phrased - they ask for specific authors - is the only way to design an exam for this kind of course. The readings represent a range of topics, and certainly a range of opinions. The readings for the course more or less represent the opposite of a course that relies on the information contained in a textbook. You cannot answer with "the right" information (except for some demographic statistics) because, as has been indicated many times, there is no definitively "right" information; it is all embedded in a political and often moral, context. So indicating who said what when you're writing about a given issue is crucial. And the only way you can indicate who is saying what is by referring to the author.

The exam will consist of 3 essay questions, an hour a piece.

It's fine to review your notes on class lectures, but bear in mind when preparing that the exam focuses on the readings.

We **will not** be looking for well-written papers, so don't spend time constructing elegant sentences. Your essay should have a structure, but it will probably be a very simple one: answering the question by discussing the readings one after the other, or choosing topics and discussing what each reading has to say about each topic.

**Ink required**. Don't waste time whiting out mistakes, just cross them out and continue.

Write on one side of the page.

We will provide the blue books.
